## About MSSA
The Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) is a 17-week technical training program for transitioning service members and veterans, designed to prepare participants for careers in the technology industry.

This repository showcases my progress through the Cloud Application Development (CAD) learning path, focusing on software engineering and application development skills.

## Course Details
- Course Start: January 13th, 2025
- Course End: May 2025
- Track: Cloud Application Development (PCAD16)

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by weeks and days:

- `weekX/dayY/wDXXCX`
  - `weekX`: The week of the course (e.g., `week1`, `week2`, etc.).
  - `dayX`: The specific day of the week (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.).
  - `wDXXCX`: The code file(s) produced on that specific day. Each code file is numbered sequentially (e.g., `w1D1C1`, `w1D1C2`).

## Example
```plaintext
week1/
  day1/
    w1D1C1
    w1D1C2
  day2/
    w1D2C1
week2/
  day1/
    w2D1C1



### How to Use This Code
1. Copy the entire block above.
2. Create a new file in your GitHub repository or local project folder and name it `README.md`.
3. Paste the code into the file.
4. Commit and push the file to your GitHub repository. GitHub will automatically render the Markdown into a formatted README page.

### Additional Tips
- You can customize the dates, track name, or file naming convention to suit your needs.
- If you want to add images, links, or tables later, let me know, and I can provide the additional Markdown syntax.
- Ensure the file extension is `.md` (Markdown) for GitHub to recognize and render it properly.
